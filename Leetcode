LinkedList Sum problems
  2.Add Two Numbers
    method 1 add number accordingly, add the additional number at last
    
  445.Add Two Numbers II
    method 1 get int numbers from the linkedlist first, then get the sum and turn into linkedlist as result
    method 2 iterate through the linkedlist, turn into stack, do the reverse iterate from stack
  
  43. Multiply Strings
    method 1 make function multiply, function add, iterate the small number to sum up the result.

N Sum Problems
  1. Two Sum
    method 1 brute force, iterate all the pairs, O(n^2)
    method 2 sort list, two pointer
    method 3 dictionary
  
  15. 3 Sum
    method 1 sort first, then two pointer, iterate through the first element
             no duplicate, need to skip some numbers, if it's the same with previous one
  16. 3 Sum Closest
    method 1 sort first, iterate through all the rest pairs, update result every time.
